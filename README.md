# smart-lights
A hassle-free household cloud connected lighting system. The wifi-connected device interfaces with standard household lightswitches via a 3D printed lightswitch cover (see `3DModels/`). The included React appliction makes calls to my [conduit](https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit) IoT service to easily execute remote light-switching functions on the target ESP8266 device from anywhere in the world (firmware and libs needed can be found in `firmware/`). The whole stack for this project--including firmware, hardware, server (see my [conduit](https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit) repo), client web appliction, and physical 3D printed components were designed and built from the ground up.
