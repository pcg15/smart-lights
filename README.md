# smart-lights
A hassle-free household cloud connected lighting system. The wifi-connected device interfaces with standard household lightswitches via a 3D printed lightswitch cover (see `3DModels/`). The included React appliction makes calls to my [Home Automation](https://github.com/suyashkumar/home-automation) service to easily execute remote light-switching functions on the target ESP8266 device from anywhere in the world (firmware and libs needed can be found in `firmware/`). Shameless plug: the home automation service can execute arbitrary firmware functions on a target device with no modification needed on the server side, which is pretty cool!
